# Bellabeat-Data-Analytics-Project
Google Data Analytics Capstone Project analyzing Bellabeat's smart device data using Excel, SQL and Tableau

This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, where I applied the Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act phases of data analysis to a real-world business scenario.

The focus is on Bellabeat, company that manufactures smart devices for women. The analysis explores user activity, sleep, and calorie data to uncover insights that can help Bellabeat enhance its marketing strategy and product engagement.

## Objectives
-Understand how users engage with smart device data
-Identify trends in activity, calories, and sleep patterns
-Provide data-driven recommendations for Bellabeat’s growth strategy

## Tools
-Excel: Data cleaning and exploration
-SQL: Querying and data analysis
-Tableau: Data visualization and dashboard creation

## Key Insights
-Calories burned are strongly tied to daily steps
-Uneven activity levels across users
-Sleep tracking is underutilized compared to activity tracking.
-Only a small number of users achieve 10,000 steps/day.

## Recommendations
-Step Challenges: Launch challenges to push users closer to 10K daily steps.
-Introduce dashboard in app to show users how activity impacts calorie burn directly
-Personalized Notifications: Send reminders to inactive users and celebrate milestones.
-Promote Bellabeat’s sleep-tracking features
